# Notepad Lite
This calculator was designed for low-end computers. It only contains the essentials for document creation: copy, cut, paste, save, save as and open.

The point of the program is that it was designed to make Notepad launch quickly on any low-end computer. For example, when I sat down at my school computer and needed to use Notepad, it took too long to launch, even though it cost $300.

That's why I created my own notepad to solve situations like this: the notepad takes a long time to open or freezes.
